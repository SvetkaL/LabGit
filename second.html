Dear Raven,

What’s your name? My mama doesn’t know, and I asked her to ask your mama, but she said she doesn’t want to go anywhere near your house. I told her that’s mean because she doesn’t know you. None of us do. I’ve only seen you from across the street. You have black hair, and it’s very dark, which is why I call you Raven. If you tell me your real name I will use it.

Is black your favorite color? You wear it a lot. I’ve never seen you wear anything but that black dress with the poofy sleeves and lacy collar. Or are you sad because someone in your family has died? My mama said that black is a color for being sad, and for funerals. I’ve never been to one. My favorite color is all of them.

Do you go to school? I’ve never seen you there, and I think there’s only one. Do you have many friends? I have lots. They wave at me when they see me and say hi when I’m walking down the street. Sometimes I forget their names, so I make up names in my head, like there’s this red-haired girl I call Poppy, and this boy who only brings peanut butter and honey sandwiches for lunch, so I call him Honey, because the peanut butter isn’t the unusual part. His hair is also yellow like honey.

What do you eat for lunch? I don’t think it would be peanut butter and honey sandwiches. I imagine you eating raspberries.

Tell me what your name is so I can use it.


Sincerely,

Robin
